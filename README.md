### Notes
This project is based on the problem statement of <a href = "https://www.codechef.com/learn/course/projects-python">Codechef's "Python Projects"</a>. I solved the challenges and developed the logic for this password generator. Here's my <a href = "https://www.codechef.com/certificates/public/d9bca07">certificate</a> for the course.

Planning to add to this project by:
- increasing the frequency of numbers and special characters in the password
- making a program for suggesting usernames based on email ID
